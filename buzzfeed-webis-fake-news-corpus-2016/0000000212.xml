    <mainText>Itâs no secret that Bill Maher, comedian extraordinaire and host of HBOâsÂ is no fan of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. So, of course he couldnât resist live tweeting the entire first general election presidential debate between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The whole thing was one brilliant insult against Trump after another. Here are a few of the better tweets: GOP won expectations game when it nominated an orangutan. As long as he doesn't fling his poop, "Surprisingly dignified Trump last night" â Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016  Want to see Hillary come out and say "The Russians just handed me your tax returns" just to see if Trump bolts â Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016  Trump adjusting his Spanx right now, and one final pass with the can of Final Netâ¦ â Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016  Trump proud of himself that he called her "Secretary Clinton" â as opposed to what, Bitchula? â Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016  Trump. Wearing a tie made in China, just sayin' â Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016  OK,I hope she's playing rope-a-dope, and I do mean dope, because I'm getting tired of this vile nincompoop bullying and lieing and its early â Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016  Trump: "Being in Iraq was a disaster, but we shld take the oil"WE WLD HAVE TO BE BACK IN IRAQ TO TAKE THE OIL! They won't give it to a drone â Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016  btw, you know a charge agst Trump is 100% provably true when he interrupts with "Wrong!" #debates â Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016  And, of course, for his closers, Maher had to do what heâs been doing on his show ever since it became clear who the nominees would be, and hit those who refuse to vote for Hillary: However this comes out, I have so little respect for the electorate just that its this close. She's right, she shld be 50 points ahead. â Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016  But he definitely saved his best line for last, as he called Trump his favorite phrase: Negative ads in a political race are "not nice?" There's no crying in politics, you #WhinyLittleBitch! â Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016  Letâs face it, no matter how Trumpâs surrogates try to spin this â and they are already out in force doing their damndest â he lost this thing tonight, badly. He made an absolute fool of himself. Thereâs just no way around it. Of course, his uneducated core supporters will still vote for him, but thereâs no way this one got the undecided voters into Trumpâs corner. The one thing tonight did do, though, is give us plenty of entertainment. </mainText>
