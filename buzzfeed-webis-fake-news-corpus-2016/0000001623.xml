    <mainText>On the topic of climate change, Hillary Clinton seems more knowledgeable of Donald Trump’s words than he does. Earlier in Monday night’s presidential debate at Hofstra University, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton pointed out that the GOP nominee previously said that climate change was a hoax created by the Chinese. Trump immediately responded, saying, “I did not. I do not say that.” But in 2012, long before he was running for the White House, Trump tweeted that exact statement. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012  The debate over whether or not Trump made that statement happened earlier in the campaign, when Clinton referenced the statement in a June speech. Politifact confirmed the claim as true, referencing Trump’s 2012 tweet.          </mainText>
