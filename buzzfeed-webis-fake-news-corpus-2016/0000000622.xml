You’ve heard of blowing yourself to Hell. Watch someone LITERALLY do it… and bring his murderous buddies with him! Watch:  Something this stupid is best celebrated with mockery. There is ONE song that does so perfectly: (apologies in advance)  This is GREAT news — just ask their intended victims! — And everybody loves to hear good news, so SHARE it! </mainText>
