    <mainText>Wouldnât it be nice if we could just kick bigots out of our country? Well, thatâs exactly what happened when anti-gay Arizona pastor Stephen Anderson stopped by BotswanaÂ for a visit and decided to preach hate. Andersonâs roadÂ  Botswana was an eventful one, with the United Kingdom banning him from so much as getting on a connecting flight in their country. This forced him to find a âroundaboutâ way to get to Botswana, where he intended to spend quite some time preaching. But after he suggested that homosexuals be stoned to death in a radio interview, Anderson learned that his hatred is not tolerated everywhere. âI have identified Steven Anderson as an undesirable person to travel to South Africa,â Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba told the BBC. The countryâs Constitution, unlike ours, prohibits hate speech against, among other things, the gay community (even though homosexual acts are illegal in Botswana) Â â and if youâve ever listened to Anderson speak for five minutes straight, you know hate speech isÂ kind of his âthing.â The government even tweeted to inform everyone he had been declared a âprohibited immigrantâ: Pastor #StevenAnderson, a #USA citizen has been declared a Prohibited Immigrant and as such is being deported from #Botswana â Botswana Government (@BWGovernment) September 20, 2016  What prompted his removal was a radio interview in which he said homosexuals should be âstoned to death.â Anderson also repeated his praise of the Pulse nightclub shooter. While he says he doesnât advocate violence, the victims were âdisgusting homosexuals who the Bible says are worthy of death, the Bible says the government should put them to death, so why would I be sad if these horrible people died that the Bible says should die anyway.â Anderson told his interviewer, who pointed out that the Bible supports slavery, that while he doesnât believe the Bible condones slavery (it does), âif it did then yes I would condone itâ because âthe Bible is always right and I am not smarter than God.â In the past, Anderson has blamed the terrorist attacks in France earlier this year on the countryâs acceptance of âf*ggots,âÂ has called the Orlando massacre âgood newsâ because a bunch of âf*ggotsâ died (he later expanded on that by adding that âperfect Christiansâ would âbatheâ in the blood of the slaughtered innocents while singing praise to God), has prayed for the death of President Obama and asked God to rip out Caitlyn Jennerâs heartÂ and even suggested executing every gay person in the world âto cure AIDS.â You can watch Anderson getting snaggedÂ by immigration officials below. If youâre anything like me, youâll play it on repeat and laugh.  You can see an interview with his camera guy here:  </mainText>
