    <mainText>In a particularly tense interview on CNN, Trump was called out for saying that Hillary Clinton is a âbigot.â When he was asked for any particular reasons on why, he just couldnât explain himself. He tried to pivot away from the question at handÂ and made himself look really foolish. Here is the exchange: Â Anderson Cooper: Youâve previously called Hillary Clinton Â a bigot. How is she a bigot? Trump: Well, sheâs a bigot. Anderson Cooper: But, how is she bigoted? Bigotry is having a hatred towards a particular group. Trump: Sheâs not doing anything for those communities. Anderson Cooper: (Again) So, youâre saying she has hatred or dislike of black people? Trump: Her policies are bigoted. Anderson Cooper: But, you said her policies are âpersonally bigoted.â Trump: Oh she is. Of course she is. Sheâs totally bigoted thereâs no question about that. Anderson Cooper: But, it does imply that she has antipathy, that she has hatred toward, I guess in this case youâre talking about African-Americans, but I donât want to put words in your mouth. But, is hatred at the core of that? Or dislike of African-Americans? Trump: Or maybe sheâs lazy.  Â  </mainText>
