    <mainText>If thereâs anyone in this day and age who most definitely doesnât mince words, and will say what needs to be said, itâs Vice President Joe Biden. While speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on a campaign stop for Hillary Clinton, Biden tore into some of the remarks from Mondayâs debate. Especially when Donald Trump seemed to think itâs perfectly fine to screw over the American people, or benefit from their sorrow. Biden said: âThis is a guy who said â and wants to be president â that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?â Adding: âEvery president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what weâre supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.â Then really getting to the core of it, he said: âHe does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have. They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they donât take pleasure from âYouâre fired.â They donât take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.â Biden also talked about how Trump seems proud of not paying taxes. Taxes that all of us have to pay and donât have the luxury of manipulating the tax code to our advantage. âHe acknowledged that he didnât pay taxes because, he said, heâs smart. Makes him smart. Tell that to the janitor in here whoâs paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.â Biden knows, as we should all know by this point in the election, who the better choice is for Commander-in-Chief. He reiterates: âIf this choice isnât clear, I donât know â- my lordâ¦ What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.â And itâs true, the choice is abundantly clear â Hillary Rodham Clinton should and be our next president.
