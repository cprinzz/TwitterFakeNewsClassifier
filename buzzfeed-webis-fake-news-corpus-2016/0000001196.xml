    <mainText>Incumbent senators have healthy leads over their challengers in Iowa, Colorado and Georgia, according to a trio of Quinnipiac University polls of likely voters released Friday afternoon. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley has an 11-point advantage over former Lt. Gov. Patty Judge, 55 percent to 43 percent. Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet leads El Paso County Commissioner Darryl Glenn by 9 points, 52 percent to 43 percent. And Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson tops his opponent, Jim Barksdale, 55 percent to 34 percent. The polling results mirror the current presidential standing. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton holds a narrow advantage over Donald Trump in Colorado, where Bennet, a Democrat, also leads. Trump, however, has 6- and 7-point leads over Clinton in Iowa and Georgia, respectively. The surveys were conducted Sept. 13-21. The Iowa poll of 612 likely voters has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points, while the Colorado and Georgia surveys of 644 and 638 likely voters, respectively, both have a margin of error of 3.9 percentage points.</mainText>
