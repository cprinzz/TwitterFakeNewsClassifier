    <mainText>Months ago, former First Lady Laura Bush shocked Americans when she said sheâd rather vote for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton than a Republican this election. For the most part, former presidential candidate Jeb Bush and former presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush have optedÂ to stay out of this election â until now. Word of George H.W. Bushâs decision to snub the GOP by not voting for its disastrous Republican nominee just recently broke, and itâs a super provocative move because not only is Bush refusing to support his party, but he is voting for the Democratic Party instead. Itâs a controversial decision, but obviously Bush recognizes that itâs the smartest choice for the future of this country. The Trump campaign, as you can imagine, isnât taking this lightly. In an interview with CNNâs Erin Burnett, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway reacted to the elder Bushâs voting decision and couldnât have demonstrated any better how immature and bitter the campaign was about it. Conway said that although she ârespectsâ Bushâs choice, itâs ironic that heâs voting forÂ âthe wife of the man who knocked him out of the raceâ in 1992. Conway alsoÂ chalked up Bushâs decision to vote for Clinton to his emotions and âhurt feelingsâ over his sonâs loss to Trump in the primaries. She said: âThis was a bruising primary, and Jeb Bush really failed all expectationsâ¦ I know there are a lot of hurt feelings there.â You can watch the interview below: âJeb Bush really failedâ¦there are a lot of hurt feelingsâ @KellyannePolls on Bush 41 voting #Clinton https://t.co/iyhiLRgrPL â OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) September 20, 2016  This response from the Trump campaign is exactly what weâd expect it to be. The Bush familyÂ is making a responsible, informed decision during this election, and that is way too much for Trump and his minions to wrap their feeble minds around. This election is no joke â itâs about far more than Republican and Democrat parties. Itâs about saving the country from a candidate that will destroy it â and the Bushâs are smart enough to recognize that. </mainText>
