As Written By Dan Riehl for Breitbart: Long-time Democratic pollster Pat Caddell joinedBreitbart News DailySiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday to discuss recent polling, as well as news that former President George H.W.

It’s really an insurgency against the political class by the people. That’s why both Bernie Sanders and Trump did so well” in their respective primaries. Added Caddell, “Behind closed doors, what you have is a sense of an alliance,” pointing out that while one party may be up and the other down at times, they still “eat at the same trough” in Washington. Caddell went on to discuss recent polling, as well as what to expect going forward. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern…..
