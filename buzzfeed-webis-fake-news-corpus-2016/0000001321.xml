    <mainText>Nearly 55 million people viewed "debate-related" live videos on Facebook, the social media site said Tuesday morning. It's not clear for how long people would watch the videos, but the high number adds to the expectation that more than 80 million people will have watched the debate on television. Some 18.6 million people on Facebook in the United States generated 73.8 million likes, posts, comments and shares related to the debate. The top issues discussed were taxes, the Islamic State, racial issues, the economy, and crime and criminal justice. Trump dominated the conversation on Facebook, taking 79 percent to Clinton's 21 percent.</mainText>
