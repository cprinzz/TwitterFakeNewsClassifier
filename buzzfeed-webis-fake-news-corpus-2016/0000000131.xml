    <mainText>While rock band U2âs Bono has had a career of being politically outspoken, his priorities have generally been focused â primarily on improving living conditions in underdeveloped countries. Heck, the liberal Bono even found common ground with George W. Bush. Thereâs no common ground to be found with Donald Trump, though, who the U2 singer called âpotentially the worst idea that every happened to America.â In an interview with , Bono gave credence to the idea of American exceptionalism, but he feels that Trump destroys that. In fact, Bono says, Trump could âdestroyâ the very idea of America: âLook, America is like the best idea the world ever came up with,â Bono, whose real name is Paul David Hewson, told âCBS This Morningâ in an interview broadcast Tuesday. âBut Donald Trump is potentially the worst idea that ever happened to America. Potentially.â Bono pointed to nations like Ireland and Great Britain as great countries but suggested that America is different because itâs an idea, one that Trump is âtrying to hijack.â âThat idea is bound up in justice and equality for all â equality and justice for all, you know,â he continued. âI think heâs hijacked the party. I think heâs trying to hijack the idea of America. And I think itâs bigger than all of us. I think itâs â itâs â this is really dangerous.â Source: Politico Hereâs the video:  Say what you want about the often controversial Bono, but he has seen the world and heâs right. The idea of America, as a melting pot, as a place where with hard work, anyone can be a success, is not completely incompatible with Donald Trumpâs ideas. Trump is a xenophobe. He and his supporters want to turn our nation into a solitary island. Thatâs never been what our nation is about. </mainText>
