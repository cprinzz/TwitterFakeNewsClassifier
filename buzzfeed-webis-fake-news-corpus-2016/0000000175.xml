    <mainText>Terence Crutcher, 40, was shot once and killed by Tulsa police officer Betty Shelby at around 7:40 p.m. Friday. Before the fatal shooting, police received reports of an abandoned vehicle blocking a road. On Monday, the police department released aerial video of the incident. Shelby’s husband and an unidentified pilot are heard telling each other than they believe the “black dude” was dangerous and “needed to be tasered.” It was later discovered that Mr. Crutcher was unarmed. He wasn’t a danger and his arms were in the air when he was shot dead by Officer Shelby. Crutcher’s vehicle had stalled in the street and was seeking assistance. The Associated Press reports: Prosecutors in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have filed first-degree manslaughter charges against the white police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black man on a city street. District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler filed the charges Thursday against officer Betty Shelby, who shot and killed 40-year-old Terence Crutcher on Sept. 16. Dashcam and aerial footage of the shooting and its aftermath showed Crutcher walking away from Shelby with his arms in the air. Shelby had a stun gun on her at the time but chose not to use it and instead, opted for deadly force. BREAKING: Prosecutor announces 1st-degree manslaughter charges against Tulsa officer who fatally shot Terence Crutcher. — The Associated Press (@AP) September 22, 2016  Officer Shelby has quite a history. When applying for a job with the sheriff’s office, she described previous marijuana use. In addition, she admitted to two previous domestic-related incidents involving the courts. She told of a 1993 incident in which she and her boyfriend at the time damaged each other’s vehicles when they were breaking up. Both filed temporary restraining orders that were subsequently dismissed. And then there’s a 2002 incident in which she said her ex-husband’s new wife filed a protective order which claimed that Shelby made harassing phone calls to her. Later, the protective order was later denied, according to what Shelby said in her application. “The Judge saw that I was not guilty of the accusations made against me,” she stated at the time. On Monday, the department said that Shelby is on paid administrative leave. That’s the protocol for a shooting at the hands of a police officer. And today, she faces first-degree manslaughter charges. Video of the incident: If the police shooting of Terence Crutcher is acceptable to you, then you need to reevaluate your life.</mainText>
