    <mainText>In 2011, St. Louis police officer Jason Stockley shot and killed Anthony Lamar Smith, a drug suspect that he was trying to arrest. At the time, Stockley claimed that he saw Smith reaching for a gun, which is why he fired his. Self-defense, thatâs all it ever is, isnât it? The problem isâ¦Smith was unarmed and now thereâs not just evidence of that, but thereâs also evidence that Stockley may have done worse than lie. There is a strong possibility that he planted the gun in Smithâs car after murdering him to cover his own ass. Smith did flee the scene of a possible drug deal and a high-speed chase ensued. Stockley was carrying a personally-owned AK-47 that Smith, in escaping, almost knocked out of his hands. Stockley was not authorized to carry that weapon while on duty, which goes a long way towards demonstrating Stockley as an unethical officer at the very least. He was also recorded as saying that he was going to kill Smith. Stockleyâs partner, Brian Bianchi, said that he warned Stockley about a revolver on the seat of Smithâs car, and Stockley himself said he feared Smith was about to pull the revolver when he approached: âBefore striking me [with his car], I observed, in plain view in the subjectâs hand while resting on the passenger seat, a silver handgun. The handgun was pointing up and towards meâ¦ Because of the presence of a weapon and because I felt my personal safety was in jeopardy, as was the safety of P.O. Bianchi, and bystanders, I fired several shots at the subject.â Itâs apparently hard to see in the videos whether Stockley handled the revolver; however, itâs damned telling that only his DNA was on the gun. Something of Smith would definitely have been there if heâd been handling the gun, as Stockley alleged. The St. Louis Board of Police Commissioners did pay a $900,000 settlement to Smithâs family in 2013, but Stockley himself was not charged with murder. That is, until this year, when this new evidence came to light. Stockley is now charged with first-degree murder, but is free on a $1 million bond. He left the St. Louis Police Department in 2013.
