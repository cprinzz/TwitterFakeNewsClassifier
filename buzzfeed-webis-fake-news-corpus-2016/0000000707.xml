    <mainText>On Friday morning, Donald Trump released additional names to add to his list of potential Supreme Court nominees should he win the general election for the presidency in November. One of the names on the list is Utah Senator Mike Lee, a constitutional expert who clerked under Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito. Upon learning that Trump listed him as a potential nominee, Lee immediately put any speculation as to whether he would accept such a nomination to rest. Conn Carroll, spokesman for Mike Lee’s office said, “Sen. Lee already has the job he wants which is why he is campaigning to represent the great people of Utah again this year.” Here are the new additions to Trump’s SCOTUS list. Donald Trump will release an expanded list of potential SCOTUS picks later today, @chucktodd reports—here are the new additions: pic.twitter.com/P7TdYwUYSb — Alexandra Jaffe (@ajjaffe) September 23, 2016   Email Subscribe</mainText>
