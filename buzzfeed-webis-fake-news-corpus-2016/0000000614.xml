    <mainText>Hillary Clinton was giving a speech in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Monday, she appeared to have something quite off about her appearance. Watch her eyes! What is up with that? It looks almost neurological. We are not doctors but someone needs to check this out its almost a loss of control of her eyes. Make sure you watch her left eye (our right) and then replay it and watch how they are not really in sync with one another in several instances.</mainText>
