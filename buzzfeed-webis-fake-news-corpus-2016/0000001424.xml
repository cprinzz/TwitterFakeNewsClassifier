    <mainText>While presidential nominees Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton may be neck-and-neck in poll numbers, the Republican candidate has been overwhelmingly winning in rally attendance and momentum. On Monday, Trump packed an Estero, Florida, arena with an estimated 8,000 people inside and more outside, despite the sweltering 90-degree weather, the Fort Myers News-Press reported. Meanwhile, on the same day in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Clinton’s speech at Temple University drew fewer than 200 people, according to Politico reporter Michael Grunwald. Clinton’s event was supposed to attract millennial voters — people she desperately needs if she wants to be victorious in November, according to WCAU. But photos and reports from the event showed that the few millennials who actually showed up to the event weren’t exactly enthused about it. Fox News contributor Jesse Watters posted a photo to social media that showed the true “vibe” of the Clinton event:  So this is the vibe at the Hillary Clinton "rally" right now… #imwithher #turnup A photo posted by Jesse Watters (@jessewatters) on Sep 19, 2016 at 9:11am PDT  It’s hard to tell who was more excited about hearing Clinton speak — the young woman or the fire extinguisher. The GOP candidate also noted the vast differences between his and his Democrat rival’s campaign crowds in recent weeks. “I can say this, when Hillary comes in, she has very small crowds,” Trump said. The Republican businessman, by contrast, has had no trouble packing large arenas, stadiums and other locations for his campaign events — a great sign in the weeks leading up to the November election. On Sept. 9, the Trump campaign held a rally in Pensacola that drew 12,000 people, according to WTSP. The Estero crowd was nearly as impressive with its 8,000 people, particularly when compared to Clinton’s recent South Florida event that attracted a much smaller 1,500 person crowd, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

Hillary can put a few kids in the rafters but there are still less than 200 people here. pic.twitter.com/IVXWS9dezm — Michael Grunwald (@MikeGrunwald) September 19, 2016  The turnout of supporters to these campaign events is indicative of how well Trump has been reaching and convincing voters to support his candidacy, while Clinton seems to be struggling at the worst possible time.
