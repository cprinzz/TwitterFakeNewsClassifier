Story Continued Below "The West Wing," an accounting of the White House under fictional President Josiah Bartlet (Martin Sheen), has been off the air for a decade. The show was created by Aaron Sorkin and netted 26 prime-time Emmy Awards during its run. Since the show ended, some cast members have touted their role in inspiring viewers to pursue a career in politics. In an interview on NBC’s "Today" show, Schiff recalled meeting fans of the show who, at the time, were staffers for Sen. Barack Obama.</mainText>
