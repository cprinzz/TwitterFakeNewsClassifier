    <mainText>In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a “powerful hate group,” has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available. [Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America’s Most Powerful HATE Group] As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author’s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get “Hillary the Horrible” into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election. A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone – especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President – to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud. The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters – but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens – to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America. Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible. Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America’s most powerful “Hate Group,” not only wants “Hillary the Horrible” to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed. Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.
