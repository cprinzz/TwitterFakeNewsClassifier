    <mainText>Ivanka Trump met privately with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, Monday in New York City, sources confirmed to ABC News. Trump, who requested the meeting, attended Ryan's speech at the Economic Club of New York before the two had a scheduled meeting.     Ryan shared some of his experiences from the 2012 presidential campaign trail and Trump provided Ryan with an update on her father's presidential campaign, according to a source. Ryan has not crossed paths with Trump or his family since the Republican National Convention. He has been running a parallel election-year campaign touting the House GOP "Better Way" policy agenda and raising money for Republicans in the House and Senate, setting fundraising records. Last week, he suggested Trump should release his tax returns. Ivanka Trump, who is one of her father's closest confidantes, has kept in touch with Hill Republicans throughout the presidential campaign on policy issues. She also joined her father in Washington, D.C. for his meetings with House and Senate Republicans in early July. "She was good," Rep. Peter King, R-New York, told reporters at the time. ABC's John Santucci contributed to this report.</mainText>
